:TODO: Render correctly-sized images from EPS files.
:TODO: Rewrite all the eps files by hand
	- As minimal as possible
	- All eps files should be exactly 1 inch by 1 inch.

:TODO: Tileset config files.
	- Board size (i.e. chess would be 8x8)
	- Number of piece images.
	- Colors or images for background tiles.
	- Colors for tile borders (selected and normal)

:TODO: Toolbox tiles
:TODO: Fix 'png'
	- The plan9 image converters don't support transparency except for
	  'gif'.
	- Ghostscript doesn't support GIF
	- GIF sucks
	- For now I'm converting {eps -> png -> gif -> plan9}
	- It would be better to make 'png' support transparency so we can just
	  do {eps -> png -> plan9}.
